# Automated-Restaurant-Order-System-Using-ZigBee

In restaurants menu cards are available on each table .we can refer it & place our order to the waiter. But we never noticed disadvantages of this conventional method. You need to wait for the waiter to attend to you. Even it becomes difficult for the restaurant manager to keep the changing prices on menu card. At the same time adding the new menu to the same card becomes a tedious job for anyone who is responsible for this job since changing menu card within less time may result in cost rise. To overcome these problems, this system installed on every table for ordering the menu. These units will work as slave units & will be connected to central unit which can be kept at managers table.
